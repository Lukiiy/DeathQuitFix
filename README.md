# DeathQuitFix

A b1.7.3 mod that fixes the death screen's quit button by adding code from the pause menu's button. By that I mean the code that increases the "LeaveGame" stat by 1 and sends a leave packet to the server (if you're in one). 

> [!NOTE]  
> As of 1/3/2026, this mod will no longer be updated (well, not like it needed one.. It works just fine). The code for this mod has now been included in another mod that also fixes some multiplayer issues, here it is if you want: [MiniMPPatches](https://github.com/Lukiiy/MiniMPPatches)  

Requires **[Babric](https://babric.github.io/use/installer/)**.
