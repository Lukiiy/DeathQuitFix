# DeathQuitFix

A b1.7.3 mod that fixes the death screen's quit button by adding code from the pause menu's button. By that I mean the code that increases the "LeaveGame" stat by 1 and sends a leave packet to the server (if you're in one). 

Requires **[Babric](https://babric.github.io/use/installer/)**.
